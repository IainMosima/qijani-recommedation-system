The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates.\\nNormally, carbohydrates in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is important in fueling brain function. However, if only a little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies, the latter passing into the brain and replacing glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood (a state called ketosis) eventually lowers the frequency of epileptic seizures. Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists after discontinuing the diet. Some evidence shows that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective. Side effects may include constipation, high cholesterol, growth slowing, acidosis, and kidney stones.\\nThe original therapeutic diet for paediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient calories to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective anticonvulsant medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ketogenic ratio or ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter. Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.\\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams, whose son\\'s severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC\\'s Dateline program and ...First Do No Harm (1997), a made-for-television film starring Meryl Streep. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which—announced in 1996—marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.\\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: Alzheimer\\'s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, headache, neurotrauma, pain, Parkinson\\'s disease, and sleep disorders.\\n\\n\\n== Epilepsy ==\\nEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders after migraine and stroke, affecting around 50 million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to a specific part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness).

After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded both inside and outside the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.\\nThe company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu, along with the company\\'s \"Specialty Sandwich\" product line, in a 1978 menu expansion. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. The expanded Burger King menu was part of a plan by then-company president Donald N. Smith to reach the broadest possible demographic market to better compete with McDonald\\'s, and to fend off then newcomer Wendy\\'s, who had a growing market share. The plan was successful: the company\\'s sales increased by 15 percent. Despite another menu expansion in 1985, the company\\'s market gains diminished due to neglect of the brand at the hands of then-parent Pillsbury and its successors, Grand Metropolitan and Diageo. When the company was sold to a group led by TPG Capital in 2004, the trend of targeting an expanded audience was renewed under a plan by its then-CEO Brad Blum. During Blum\\'s tenure, the company added several products that featured higher-quality ingredients and other menu fare that again attempted to appeal to the adult palate and demographic. As in the past, not all of these products met corporate sales expectations, or in the case of several of its larger offerings, resulted in negative publicity due to nutritional concerns. With the purchase of the company in 2010 by 3G Capital, the company again began another revamp of its product line by phasing out some products, introducing new ones and redesigning others including its flagship Whopper. \\nLike its menu, the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with, has also evolved as the company grew. The burgers have always been broiled mechanically; the original unit, called an Insta-Broiler, was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of Insta-Burger King purchased before opening their new restaurant. The Insta-Broiler worked by cooking 12 burger patties in a wire basket, allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously. With the acquisition of the chain by its Miami franchisees came an improved unit dubbed a \"Flame Broiler\". Designed by the new owners, it featured stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain. The unit broke down less often, while maintaining a similar cooking rate. The cooking format remained for the next 40 years until Burger King developed a new, variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times. These new units began testing in 1999 and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed system-wide in 2008–2009. Accompanying these new broilers was new food-holding equipment and a computer-based product monitoring system for its cooked products. The new system allows for m\\n</Document>']}, {'analyst': Analyst(name='Carb-Conscious Carl', tone='Analytical', theme='Low-Carb Nutrition', description=\"Carb-Conscious Carl is here to help you maintain your weight while sticking to a low-carb diet.

These trends amassed popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many people spent more time cooking at home while engaging with social media for entertainment. \\nFood-related content on TikTok is often categorized under the hashtags #TikTokFood and #FoodTok. These hashtags have amassed 4.6 million and 4.5 million posts, respectively, according to the platform. Some TikTok users share personal recipes and dietary habits, while others use step-by-step cooking videos to grow their online presence. \\nThe widespread popularity of these trends has influenced various aspects of society, including interest in cooking among younger generations, discussions about body image, the marketing of food products on social media, and  temporary food shortages. \\nSeveral TikTok content creators, such as Eitan Bernath, Jeron Combs, and Emily Mariko, have gained recognition  through their recipes and content. Some of the most notable TikTok food trends include the leftover salmon bowl, baked feta cheese pasta, and pesto eggs.\\n\\n\\n== Trends ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2020 ===\\n\\n\\n==== Cloud bread ====\\n\\nCloud bread is a light, fluffy low-carb bread substitute made from egg whites, corn starch, and sugar. Cloud bread gained popularity on TikTok in July 2020, and user @linqanaaa is credited for bringing it to the platform.\\n\\n\\n==== Dalgona coffee ====\\n\\nDalgona coffee is a whipped coffee drink made by combining equal parts of instant coffee, sugar, hot water, and then whisking the mixture until it forms a frothy texture. Although dalgona coffee originates from Macau, it gained popularity in South Korea where it was named after dalgona, a type of Korean candy. The trend emerged on TikTok in March 2020 during the COVID-19 quarantine in the United States.\\n\\n\\n==== Decorative focaccia bread ====\\nThe decorative focaccia bread trend, under the hashtag #focacciaart, emerged on TikTok in the spring of 2020. Users began decorating their homemade focaccia loaves with designs made from vegetables, herbs, and other edible ingredients.\\n\\n\\n==== Hot chocolate bombs ====\\n\\nHot chocolate bombs (also known as cocoa bombs) are chocolate spheres filled with hot chocolate mix and confections, such as marshmallows. When placed in hot milk, the chocolate shell melts and releases its contents. \\nEric Torres-Garcia (@erictorresg on TikTok) is credited with popularizing cocoa bombs on the platform in December 2020. The trend surged around the 2020 Christmas season, prompting some bakers and store owners to add these confections to their menus. Torres-Garcia claims he posted the first cocoa bombs video on TikTok and has since trademarked the name. Since then, many creators have attempted their own variations of the confection.\\n\\n\\n==== Mini pancake cereal ====\\n\\nMini pancake cereal consists of miniature pancakes served in a bowl, often drizzled with maple syrup and butter, to resemble traditional breakfast cereal. The trend was first introduced in April 2020 by Sydney Melhoff (@sydneymelhoff on TikTok). Following its popularity,  users developed variations of the dish using different foods, including cookies, donuts, and croissants.\\n\\n\\n=== 2021 ===\\n\\n\\n==== Baked feta cheese pasta ====\\n\\nBaked feta cheese pasta is made with a few simple ingredients: cherry tomatoes, a block of feta cheese, olive oil, pasta, basil, and garlic. The tomatoes and feta are baked together in the oven until softened, then mashed into a sauce and mixed with cooked pasta.\\nThe dish gained popularity due to its simplicity and ease of preparation. In 2019, a Finnish food blogger name Jenni Häyrinen (@liemessa on TikTok) first introduced the recipe in 2019, but it gained popularity on TikTok in February 2021. The trend became so widespread that it led to a temporary shortage of feta cheese in Finnish grocery stores.\\n\\n\\n==== Baked oats ====\\nFirst popular in the spring of 2021, baked oats is a breakfast dish similar to traditional oatmeal,\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet\"/>\\nThe ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate dietary therapy that in conventional medicine is used mainly to treat hard-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children.

The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates.\\\\nNormally, carbohydrates in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is important in fueling brain function. However, if only a little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies, the latter passing into the brain and replacing glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood (a state called ketosis) eventually lowers the frequency of epileptic seizures. Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists after discontinuing the diet. Some evidence shows that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective. Side effects may include constipation, high cholesterol, growth slowing, acidosis, and kidney stones.\\\\nThe original therapeutic diet for paediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient calories to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective anticonvulsant medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ketogenic ratio or ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter. Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.\\\\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams, whose son\\\\\\'s severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC\\\\\\'s Dateline program and ...First Do No Harm (1997), a made-for-television film starring Meryl Streep. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which—announced in 1996—marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.\\\\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: Alzheimer\\\\\\'s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, headache, neurotrauma, pain, Parkinson\\\\\\'s disease, and sleep disorders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Epilepsy ==\\\\nEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders after migraine and stroke, affecting around 50 million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to a specific part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King_products\"/>\\\\nWhen the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded both inside and outside the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.\\\\nThe company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu, along with the company\\\\\\'s \"Specialty Sandwich\" product line, in a 1978 menu expansion. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. The expanded Burger King menu was part of a plan by then-company president Donald N. Smith to reach the broadest possible demographic market to better compete with McDonald\\\\\\'s, and to fend off then newcomer Wendy\\\\\\'s, who had a growing market share. The plan was successful: the company\\\\\\'s sales increased by 15 percent. Despite another menu expansion in 1985, the company\\\\\\'s market gains diminished due to neglect of the brand at the hands of then-parent Pillsbury and its successors, Grand Metropolitan and Diageo. When the company was sold to a group led by TPG Capital in 2004, the trend of targeting an expanded audience was renewed under a plan by its then-CEO Brad Blum. During Blum\\\\\\'s tenure, the company added several products that featured higher-quality ingredients and other menu fare that again attempted to appeal to the adult palate and demographic. As in the past, not all of these products met corporate sales expectations, or in the case of several of its larger offerings, resulted in negative publicity due to nutritional concerns. With the purchase of the company in 2010 by 3G Capital, the company again began another revamp of its product line by phasing out some products, introducing new ones and redesigning others including its flagship Whopper. \\\\nLike its menu, the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with, has also evolved as the company grew. The burgers have always been broiled mechanically; the original unit, called an Insta-Broiler, was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of Insta-Burger King purchased before opening their new restaurant. The Insta-Broiler worked by cooking 12 burger patties in a wire basket, allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously. With the acquisition of the chain by its Miami franchisees came an improved unit dubbed a \"Flame Broiler\". Designed by the new owners, it featured stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain. The unit broke down less often, while maintaining a similar cooking rate. The cooking format remained for the next 40 years until Burger King developed a new, variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times. These new units began testing in 1999 and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed system-wide in 2008–2009. Accompanying these new broilers was new food-holding equipment and a computer-based product monitoring system for its cooked products. The new system allows for m\\\\n</Document>\\']}, {\\'analyst\\': Analyst(name=\\'Carb-Conscious Carl\\', tone=\\'Analytical\\', theme=\\'Low-Carb Nutrition\\', description=\"Carb-Conscious Carl is here to help you maintain your weight while sticking to a low-carb diet.

These trends amassed popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many people spent more time cooking at home while engaging with social media for entertainment. \\\\nFood-related content on TikTok is often categorized under the hashtags #TikTokFood and #FoodTok. These hashtags have amassed 4.6 million and 4.5 million posts, respectively, according to the platform. Some TikTok users share personal recipes and dietary habits, while others use step-by-step cooking videos to grow their online presence. \\\\nThe widespread popularity of these trends has influenced various aspects of society, including interest in cooking among younger generations, discussions about body image, the marketing of food products on social media, and  temporary food shortages. \\\\nSeveral TikTok content creators, such as Eitan Bernath, Jeron Combs, and Emily Mariko, have gained recognition  through their recipes and content. Some of the most notable TikTok food trends include the leftover salmon bowl, baked feta cheese pasta, and pesto eggs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Trends ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 2020 ===\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Cloud bread ====\\\\n\\\\nCloud bread is a light, fluffy low-carb bread substitute made from egg whites, corn starch, and sugar. Cloud bread gained popularity on TikTok in July 2020, and user @linqanaaa is credited for bringing it to the platform.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Dalgona coffee ====\\\\n\\\\nDalgona coffee is a whipped coffee drink made by combining equal parts of instant coffee, sugar, hot water, and then whisking the mixture until it forms a frothy texture. Although dalgona coffee originates from Macau, it gained popularity in South Korea where it was named after dalgona, a type of Korean candy. The trend emerged on TikTok in March 2020 during the COVID-19 quarantine in the United States.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Decorative focaccia bread ====\\\\nThe decorative focaccia bread trend, under the hashtag #focacciaart, emerged on TikTok in the spring of 2020. Users began decorating their homemade focaccia loaves with designs made from vegetables, herbs, and other edible ingredients.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Hot chocolate bombs ====\\\\n\\\\nHot chocolate bombs (also known as cocoa bombs) are chocolate spheres filled with hot chocolate mix and confections, such as marshmallows. When placed in hot milk, the chocolate shell melts and releases its contents. \\\\nEric Torres-Garcia (@erictorresg on TikTok) is credited with popularizing cocoa bombs on the platform in December 2020. The trend surged around the 2020 Christmas season, prompting some bakers and store owners to add these confections to their menus. Torres-Garcia claims he posted the first cocoa bombs video on TikTok and has since trademarked the name. Since then, many creators have attempted their own variations of the confection.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Mini pancake cereal ====\\\\n\\\\nMini pancake cereal consists of miniature pancakes served in a bowl, often drizzled with maple syrup and butter, to resemble traditional breakfast cereal. The trend was first introduced in April 2020 by Sydney Melhoff (@sydneymelhoff on TikTok). Following its popularity,  users developed variations of the dish using different foods, including cookies, donuts, and croissants.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 2021 ===\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Baked feta cheese pasta ====\\\\n\\\\nBaked feta cheese pasta is made with a few simple ingredients: cherry tomatoes, a block of feta cheese, olive oil, pasta, basil, and garlic. The tomatoes and feta are baked together in the oven until softened, then mashed into a sauce and mixed with cooked pasta.\\\\nThe dish gained popularity due to its simplicity and ease of preparation. In 2019, a Finnish food blogger name Jenni Häyrinen (@liemessa on TikTok) first introduced the recipe in 2019, but it gained popularity on TikTok in February 2021. The trend became so widespread that it led to a temporary shortage of feta cheese in Finnish grocery stores.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Baked oats ====\\\\nFirst popular in the spring of 2021, baked oats is a breakfast dish similar to traditional oatmeal,\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet\"/>\\\\nThe ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate dietary therapy that in conventional medicine is used mainly to treat hard-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children.

The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates.\\\\nNormally, carbohydrates in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is important in fueling brain function. However, if only a little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies, the latter passing into the brain and replacing glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood (a state called ketosis) eventually lowers the frequency of epileptic seizures. Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists after discontinuing the diet. Some evidence shows that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective. Side effects may include constipation, high cholesterol, growth slowing, acidosis, and kidney stones.\\\\nThe original therapeutic diet for paediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient calories to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective anticonvulsant medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ketogenic ratio or ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter. Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.\\\\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams, whose son\\\\\\'s severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC\\\\\\'s Dateline program and ...First Do No Harm (1997), a made-for-television film starring Meryl Streep. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which—announced in 1996—marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.\\\\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: Alzheimer\\\\\\'s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, headache, neurotrauma, pain, Parkinson\\\\\\'s disease, and sleep disorders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Epilepsy ==\\\\nEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders after migraine and stroke, affecting around 50 million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to a specific part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King_products\"/>\\\\nWhen the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded both inside and outside the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.\\\\nThe company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu, along with the company\\\\\\'s \"Specialty Sandwich\" product line, in a 1978 menu expansion. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. The expanded Burger King menu was part of a plan by then-company president Donald N. Smith to reach the broadest possible demographic market to better compete with McDonald\\\\\\'s, and to fend off then newcomer Wendy\\\\\\'s, who had a growing market share. The plan was successful: the company\\\\\\'s sales increased by 15 percent. Despite another menu expansion in 1985, the company\\\\\\'s market gains diminished due to neglect of the brand at the hands of then-parent Pillsbury and its successors, Grand Metropolitan and Diageo. When the company was sold to a group led by TPG Capital in 2004, the trend of targeting an expanded audience was renewed under a plan by its then-CEO Brad Blum. During Blum\\\\\\'s tenure, the company added several products that featured higher-quality ingredients and other menu fare that again attempted to appeal to the adult palate and demographic. As in the past, not all of these products met corporate sales expectations, or in the case of several of its larger offerings, resulted in negative publicity due to nutritional concerns. With the purchase of the company in 2010 by 3G Capital, the company again began another revamp of its product line by phasing out some products, introducing new ones and redesigning others including its flagship Whopper. \\\\nLike its menu, the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with, has also evolved as the company grew. The burgers have always been broiled mechanically; the original unit, called an Insta-Broiler, was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of Insta-Burger King purchased before opening their new restaurant. The Insta-Broiler worked by cooking 12 burger patties in a wire basket, allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously. With the acquisition of the chain by its Miami franchisees came an improved unit dubbed a \"Flame Broiler\". Designed by the new owners, it featured stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain. The unit broke down less often, while maintaining a similar cooking rate. The cooking format remained for the next 40 years until Burger King developed a new, variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times. These new units began testing in 1999 and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed system-wide in 2008–2009. Accompanying these new broilers was new food-holding equipment and a computer-based product monitoring system for its cooked products. The new system allows for m\\\\n</Document>\\']}, {\\'analyst\\': Analyst(name=\\'Carb-Conscious Carl\\', tone=\\'Analytical\\', theme=\\'Low-Carb Nutrition\\', description=\"Carb-Conscious Carl is here to help you maintain your weight while sticking to a low-carb diet.

These trends amassed popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many people spent more time cooking at home while engaging with social media for entertainment. \\\\nFood-related content on TikTok is often categorized under the hashtags #TikTokFood and #FoodTok. These hashtags have amassed 4.6 million and 4.5 million posts, respectively, according to the platform. Some TikTok users share personal recipes and dietary habits, while others use step-by-step cooking videos to grow their online presence. \\\\nThe widespread popularity of these trends has influenced various aspects of society, including interest in cooking among younger generations, discussions about body image, the marketing of food products on social media, and  temporary food shortages. \\\\nSeveral TikTok content creators, such as Eitan Bernath, Jeron Combs, and Emily Mariko, have gained recognition  through their recipes and content. Some of the most notable TikTok food trends include the leftover salmon bowl, baked feta cheese pasta, and pesto eggs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Trends ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 2020 ===\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Cloud bread ====\\\\n\\\\nCloud bread is a light, fluffy low-carb bread substitute made from egg whites, corn starch, and sugar. Cloud bread gained popularity on TikTok in July 2020, and user @linqanaaa is credited for bringing it to the platform.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Dalgona coffee ====\\\\n\\\\nDalgona coffee is a whipped coffee drink made by combining equal parts of instant coffee, sugar, hot water, and then whisking the mixture until it forms a frothy texture. Although dalgona coffee originates from Macau, it gained popularity in South Korea where it was named after dalgona, a type of Korean candy. The trend emerged on TikTok in March 2020 during the COVID-19 quarantine in the United States.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Decorative focaccia bread ====\\\\nThe decorative focaccia bread trend, under the hashtag #focacciaart, emerged on TikTok in the spring of 2020. Users began decorating their homemade focaccia loaves with designs made from vegetables, herbs, and other edible ingredients.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Hot chocolate bombs ====\\\\n\\\\nHot chocolate bombs (also known as cocoa bombs) are chocolate spheres filled with hot chocolate mix and confections, such as marshmallows. When placed in hot milk, the chocolate shell melts and releases its contents. \\\\nEric Torres-Garcia (@erictorresg on TikTok) is credited with popularizing cocoa bombs on the platform in December 2020. The trend surged around the 2020 Christmas season, prompting some bakers and store owners to add these confections to their menus. Torres-Garcia claims he posted the first cocoa bombs video on TikTok and has since trademarked the name. Since then, many creators have attempted their own variations of the confection.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Mini pancake cereal ====\\\\n\\\\nMini pancake cereal consists of miniature pancakes served in a bowl, often drizzled with maple syrup and butter, to resemble traditional breakfast cereal. The trend was first introduced in April 2020 by Sydney Melhoff (@sydneymelhoff on TikTok). Following its popularity,  users developed variations of the dish using different foods, including cookies, donuts, and croissants.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== 2021 ===\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Baked feta cheese pasta ====\\\\n\\\\nBaked feta cheese pasta is made with a few simple ingredients: cherry tomatoes, a block of feta cheese, olive oil, pasta, basil, and garlic. The tomatoes and feta are baked together in the oven until softened, then mashed into a sauce and mixed with cooked pasta.\\\\nThe dish gained popularity due to its simplicity and ease of preparation. In 2019, a Finnish food blogger name Jenni Häyrinen (@liemessa on TikTok) first introduced the recipe in 2019, but it gained popularity on TikTok in February 2021. The trend became so widespread that it led to a temporary shortage of feta cheese in Finnish grocery stores.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Baked oats ====\\\\nFirst popular in the spring of 2021, baked oats is a breakfast dish similar to traditional oatmeal,\\\\n</Document>\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n<Document href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet\"/>\\\\nThe ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate dietary therapy that in conventional medicine is used mainly to treat hard-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children.

Here are a few of my favorites:\\n\\n1. **Flavored Popcorn and Marinated Cheese**: These snacks are not only tasty but also keep your carb intake low, with just 5 or fewer grams of carbs per serving [1].\\n\\n2. **Pickles and Olives**: Both offer a salty crunch that satisfies cravings for something savory, without the higher carbohydrate content typically found in chips and pretzels. Just be mindful of the sodium content, and opt for low-sodium varieties if needed [2].\\n\\n3. **Shrimp Cocktail with No-Carb Sauce**: This is a refreshing and protein-rich option that can be quite satisfying [2].\\n\\n4. **Bone Broth**: A comforting and nutrient-rich snack, especially on a cold day. You can enjoy it on its own or pair it with low-carb bread or vegetables if you want to add some carbohydrates [2].\\n\\n5. **Jerky and Deli Meats**: These are quick, no-cook options that are carbohydrate-free if you select varieties without added sugar. They are high in protein, making them a filling snack [2].\\n\\n6. **Cheese Sticks**: With minimal carbohydrates, cheese sticks are a satisfying and delicious option that also boosts your protein intake [3].\\n\\nThese snacks not only help keep your carb intake in check but also ensure you enjoy a variety of flavors and textures.

When crafting low-carb, dairy-free lunches, the key is to focus on incorporating a variety of proteins, healthy fats, and low-carb vegetables to ensure nutritional balance and satisfaction. Here are a few strategies and examples:\\n\\n1. **Protein-Rich Salads**: Salads can be a great base for a low-carb lunch. For instance, a Dill Chicken Salad or an Avocado Tuna Salad can provide ample protein while keeping carbs low. These salads can be enhanced with ingredients like avocados, which add healthy fats and creaminess without dairy [1].\\n\\n2. **Stuffed Vegetables**: Using vegetables as vessels for other ingredients is a clever way to keep carbs low. For example, Curried Chicken Salad Stuffed Avocados offer a flavorful and filling option that combines protein and healthy fats [1].\\n\\n3. **Seafood Options**: Seafood is naturally low in carbs and can be prepared in various ways. Keto Thai Shrimp Cakes are an excellent choice, providing a flavorful and satisfying meal without dairy [1].\\n\\n4. **Soups and Stews**: A Chicken Fajita Soup can be a hearty and warming option. By focusing on broth-based soups with plenty of vegetables and proteins, you can create a filling meal that aligns with low-carb and dairy-free guidelines [1].\\n\\n5. **Meal Prepping**: Planning and preparing meals in advance can help maintain dietary goals. Utilizing weekly meal plans that are low-carb, gluten-free, and keto-friendly can simplify the process and ensure you have a variety of options ready to go [1].\\n\\nBy focusing on these strategies, you can create a diverse and satisfying menu that adheres to low-carb and dairy-free dietary preferences.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] peaceloveandlowcarb.com/low-carb-dairy-free-recipes\\n3.
